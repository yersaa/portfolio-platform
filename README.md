üîí Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup
Enhancing security, the Portfolio Platform supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). Here's how to set it up:

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Users should have a TOTP-compatible authenticator app installed on their mobile devices, such as:
Google Authenticator
Authy
Microsoft Authenticator
üóùÔ∏è Setup Steps
Enable 2FA in User Settings:

Navigate to your account settings/dashboard.
Locate the Two-Factor Authentication section.
Click on Enable 2FA.
Generate a Secret Key:

The application generates a unique secret key for your account.
A QR code representing the secret key is displayed.
Scan the QR Code:

Open your authenticator app.
Use the app to scan the displayed QR code.
The app will automatically add the Portfolio Platform account with the corresponding secret.
Verify the Setup:

Enter the 6-digit code generated by your authenticator app into the application to verify and complete the setup.
Backup Codes (Optional but Recommended):

The application provides backup codes for account recovery.
Important: Store these codes securely (e.g., in a password manager) in case you lose access to your authenticator app.
üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
Backend:
Utilizes Speakeasy for generating and verifying TOTP codes.
Stores the user's 2FA secret in the database, ensuring it's encrypted for security.
Frontend:
Provides a user-friendly interface to enable, disable, and verify 2FA.
Displays QR codes using libraries like qrcode for easy scanning.
üîê Security Considerations
Encryption: 2FA secrets are encrypted before storage to prevent unauthorized access.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on 2FA verification attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
Secure Transmission: Ensure all data transmissions, especially during 2FA setup and verification, occur over HTTPS.
üö® Troubleshooting
Cannot Scan QR Code:
Ensure your authenticator app is up to date.
Try zooming in or adjusting the screen resolution.
Lost Access to Authenticator App:
Use backup codes provided during 2FA setup to regain access.
Contact the administrator to reset 2FA for your account.
üìñ Usage
Register an Account:

Navigate to the Registration Page.
Fill in the required details and submit the form.
Login:

Go to the Login Page.
Enter your credentials and log in.
If 2FA is enabled, enter the code from your authenticator app.
Manage Portfolio:

Access your portfolio via the dashboard.
Add, edit, or delete portfolio items as per your role permissions.
Analyze Market Trends:

Visit the Market Trends page to view dynamic stock charts.
Create Visualizations:

Navigate to Create Visualization to generate custom charts.
Stay Updated with News:

Check the News section for the latest financial news.
View Stock Information:

Use the Stocks page to fetch real-time stock data.
